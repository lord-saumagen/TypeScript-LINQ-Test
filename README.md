# TypeScript-LINQ test project with qunit.

This is the test project for the "TypeScript-LINQ" module.

The test suite is based on the 'qunit' test framwork. 

## Requirements 

The references to the "TypeScript-LINQ" library and the "TypeScript-Base" library must be resolved. 

The easiest way to do this is to clone the "TypeScript-Base", "TypeScript-LINQ" and this solution and to store them in the same directory. 

## Running

You can run the test suite after a successful build of this and all dependant solutions. Select the file "TestSuite.html" in the root directory of this solution as your start page and hit the "F5" key. Make sure, that you start with one of the latest chrome or firefox browsers. There is currently no microsoft browser which supports the latest JavaScript standard.
